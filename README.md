## Project Summary

This project explores how quantum circuits can simulate complex stochastic systems by modeling a Galton Box-style Monte Carlo problem. The Galton Box, often visualized as a Plinko game, provides a physical analogy for random processes that lead to classical distributions like the Gaussian distribution. By leveraging quantum computing techniques, the project demonstrates the potential for quantum circuits to efficiently simulate such systems, which is particularly relevant for tackling high-dimensional problems involving complex interactionsâ€”such as particle transport and quantum systems.

The foundation of the project is built upon the Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT), a fundamental quantum algorithm known for providing exponential speed-up in certain computational problems compared to classical counterparts. Utilizing QFT principles, the project focuses on implementing quantum walks and Monte Carlo simulations to approximate complex probability distributions.

Key deliverables include:

1. **General Quantum Circuit Algorithm for the Galton Box:**  
   A function that generates a quantum circuit capable of simulating a Galton Box with any number of layers. This circuit applies Hadamard gates to represent superposition at each step, resulting in an output distribution that closely approximates the classical Gaussian distribution. Simulation results confirm the expected behavior through measurement statistics.

2. **Modification for Target Distributions:**  
   The project extends the quantum circuit to generate alternative target distributions using a noiseless all-to-all sampler. Implementations include an exponential distribution achieved via biased Ry rotations, and a Hadamard quantum walk distribution generated by combining Hadamard and CNOT gates to create correlated qubit states. These modifications demonstrate the flexibility of quantum circuits in modeling diverse probabilistic systems.

3. **Noise Model Optimization:**  
   Recognizing the imperfections in real quantum hardware, a custom noise model was designed using depolarizing errors to simulate typical gate errors on both single- and two-qubit operations. Circuits were compiled and simulated with this noise model to assess the impact on accuracy and to explore optimization strategies aimed at maximizing the depth and reliability of quantum simulations under realistic conditions.

4. **Statistical Distance Metrics:**  
   To evaluate how closely the simulated output distributions match their theoretical targets, several statistical distance measures were implemented. These include the Kullback-Leibler divergence, Jensen-Shannon distance, and Total Variation distance. These metrics enable rigorous quantification of stochastic deviations and noise effects, guiding further improvements in circuit design.

Overall, the project illustrates how quantum computing offers promising tools for simulating complex stochastic processes beyond classical reach. The results highlight the advantages of quantum algorithms for high-dimensional problems and emphasize the importance of noise-aware optimizations in practical quantum simulations.
